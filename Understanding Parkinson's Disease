    <h1>Parkinson's Disease: Understanding a Serious Condition</h1>
    <p>Many people believe that all tremors are related to Parkinson's, but it is more serious as it involves damage to areas of movement, balance, and coordination in the brain. The likelihood of developing Parkinson's increases with age, and it is also known as a progressive nervous system disorder.</p>

    <h2>Causes</h2>
    <p>Scientists believe that Parkinson's disease results from a combination of genetic factors and other lifestyle and environmental influences. Understanding the causes and factors of Parkinson's is quite challenging.</p>

    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <p>Some symptoms indicative of Parkinson's include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Tremors:</strong> Shaking, usually starting in a limb, often the hand or fingers.</li>
        <li><strong>Slowed movement:</strong> Over time, Parkinson's may slow your movement, making simple tasks difficult and time-consuming.</li>
        <li><strong>Rigid muscles:</strong> Muscle stiffness may occur in any part of your body, limiting your range of motion and causing pain.</li>
        <li><strong>Impaired posture and balance:</strong> Your posture may become stooped, or you may have balance problems as a result of Parkinson's.</li>
        <li><strong>Loss of automatic movements:</strong> You may have a decreased ability to perform unconscious movements, including blinking, smiling, or swinging your arms when you walk.</li>
        <li><strong>Speech changes:</strong> You may speak softly, quickly, slur, or hesitate before talking. Your speech may be more of a monotone rather than with the usual inflections.</li>
        <li><strong>Writing changes:</strong> It may become hard to write, and your writing may appear small.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> Typically appears in individuals over 60 years old.</li>
        <li><strong>Genetic factors.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Sex:</strong> Men are more likely to develop Parkinson's disease than women.</li>
        <li><strong>Exposure to toxins:</strong> Ongoing exposure to herbicides and pesticides may slightly increase your risk of Parkinson's.</li>
    </ul>
